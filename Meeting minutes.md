Week #6:

Attendees - Shiva,Satish,Akansha,Devi,Shweta

What did team do last week?
- brainsrtomed on timer functionality 
- Undestanding the code in detail 
- Using deisng patterns into the code 

What are challenges:
- Understanding design patterns and using them in the code 
- The code is so vast with use of sesssions and socket.io for realtime, it becomes difficult to easily understand it.


Discussion held:

- Discussed everyones code implementation 
- Discussed the follow up tasks and came up with individual code assignments
- Run through on algorithm 
- Code review timer and randomization implementation .

Meeting Started at 3:20 PM 9/23/2017

Attendees - Shiva,Satish,Akansha,Devi,Shwetha

What did team do last week?

research on different 2D and 3D Game Engines that can be used.
Came up with game ideas of different genres.
Discussed the concepts of each game and possible challenges.
Research on creational design patterns that can be used in game.
What are challenges:

Comparing game engines with each other is a challenge as each engine has unique feature set and library.
Choosing the right idea for the game among the options is tough due to diversified opinions on genre and functionality of game.
It was not easy to correlate the java script design patterns to game ideas because of not enough references.
