Simplicity -- the art of maximizing the amount of work not done -- is essential.

Doing the right things matters more than doing more things. That's applicable to product development as well as in other scenarios in life. When we try to do a lot of things, there are many items that may be:
Unnecessary -- not providing much value to the end user.
Not cost effective -- providing less value but adding a lot of cost to the product.
Duplicates.

Following are the steps I took to make sure simplicity in our project:
1. 1st week
   * removed the extra work of writing ideas in the chatting app by arranging a meeting after the lecture.
2. 2nd week 
   * Asked every group member to brainstorm about the idea and update the Github group with their comments.
