Implemented by- Satish Kumar Gollaprolu.

Feedback: As a team we will take every phase and iteration seriously. We demonstrate the software/documents early and often then listen carefully and make any changes needed. We will talk about the project and adapt our process to it, not the other way around.

Week 1: Tasks done in this week: 
Game Engine reasearch: Satish and swetha said to implement unity/babylon.js as it is most used game engine ..suggestion is to focus on Game idea first and choose the game engine that adapts to it.
Idea brainstorming: Swetha has proposed an idea of running game based on question and answers for which team members suggested that we should focus on action, battle kind of games to attract more users.


Week 2: Tasks done in this week:
Game idea improvement: Devi proposed an idea of strategic chess variant where goal is to reach other end of board in optimum steps. Shiva suggested to implement a Multiplayer chess variant in same board to declare last survivor as winner after other players are killed.
Tasks to be done in this week: Creating a prototype where we implement a basic chess variant where one player moves and from one cell to another from given possible suggestions. Design a prototype to strategically place the powers in board such that each player has a fair chance to win.


Week 3: Tasks done in this week: Devi has worked on the chess board design and created a rectangular chess board would be optimal to use the entire screen space. At present the team agreed to board of size 28x10. shiva is working on developing an algorithm to place static powers on the board feedback was to first decide on the what powers we are going to place on the board and their quantity and focus on the placement next.

Tasks to be done in this week: satish was not able to complete a checker board prototype for calculating moves .. so the task was split into two parts one deciding the players start position and second finding the possible moves. To work on sample design where players can kill a power and get that power attribute to them.

Week 4:
Tasks done in this week: Shiva and Devi have worked on the chessboard design using Html , css. So the feed back provided was to refactor the code and include the functionaltites on Server side and also to implement design patterns to the code.

Tasks to be done in this week: To implement socket.io for creating Mutliplayer game as use it along with node Js in server side. To create an alogorithm for randomization of static players arranged in the board.

Week 5:
Task done in this week:
Akansha has worked on creating the board view for each players but feedback was to update the code such that square id would be unique for each player.
For creating the timers feedback to is to split the work into more backlogs so that progress can be effectively tracked.
For randomizing static players feedback is to start working on the code and try to build a default config with static players and then build alogrithm to generate new patterns.

week 6:
Tasks done in this week:
Feed back is to use prototype  and factory design patterns for implementing the static players for board.
To create timers after each player move so that player can be static.

week 7:
Tasks done in this week:
Feedback is to create functions to display the timer on the front end for players to see.
