`Courage :`

We will tell the truth about progress and estimates. We don't document excuses for failure because we plan to succeed. We don't fear anything because no one ever works alone. We will adapt to changes when ever they happen.

_Week #1:_
- Team has made an effort to make sure our task boards are accurate about the progress.
- When the game idea was finalized,the team had the fear of possessing knowledge and capability to implement the algorithm which could be complex.But we decided to work hard and proceed only because we felt the Idea was innovative. 


_Week #2:_
- We showed the courage by tweaking the game idea to large extent to make it more intresting. 
- Also team has made honest atempts to make sure our task boards are accurate about the progress.
