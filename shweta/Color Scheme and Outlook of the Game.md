we can keep the checkerboard very simple in two colors - like (white and orange) 
and we can give each player a specific color(red, blue, yellow, orange, pink, green etc), 
while the randomly placed actors will be in jet black colors. 
the palyer can choose the color while starting the game.
The different colors will help all the players to know which is an opponent player and which is an actor that can be safely acquired by them.
